            <p>Projects
                •	Red-Black Tree: In this assignment I have implemented a red-black tree (RBT) using C++ classes, inheritance, and upcasting.
                •	Pseudo-Shell: Implemented in C a single-threaded UNIX system command-line interface: implemented a pseudo-shell that can execute a number of UNIX system commands. The following are the functionalities of this pseudo-shell: Shell modes: The shell can be started in one of two modes: A) File mode, B) Interactive mode.
                •	Master Control Program: implemented in C an MCP whose primary job is to launch a pool of sub-processes that will execute commands given in an input file. The MCP will read a list of commands (with arguments) to run from a file, it will then start up and run the process that will execute the command, and then schedule the processes to run concurrently in a time-sliced manner. In addition, the MCP will monitor the processes, keeping track of how the processes is using system resources.
                •	Encryption 101: a program that encrypts and decrypts using several different ciphers. The ciphers are a) substitution cipher, b) Caesar cipher, c) ROT13 cipher, d) Running Key cipher, and e) Vigenère cipher.
                •	MongoDB and docker-compose: Implemented in python the purpose of this project is also too create a storage interaction for acp times using MongoDB and docker-compose to be able to store the brevet distance and times from website in a database and be able to call back that data and overwrite it using two buttons implemented onto the webpage, Brevet time calculator with MongoDB.
